Write a program to implement Tower of Hanoi.

It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod.

The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top.

We have to obtain the same stack on the third rod.

﻿Input Format:

One line contain number of disks a(1 <= a <= 13).
﻿Output Format:

Sequence of moves throughout the process(for better understanding refer to sample output section).
Sample Input:

3
Sample Output:

The sequence of moves involved in the Tower of Hanoi are :

1 A C

2 A B

1 C B

3 A C

1 B A

2 B C

1 A C



Explanation : 1 A C Means - Move disk 1 from A to C.
