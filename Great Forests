Great Forests
Let us imagine a field as a 2D plane. Each cell is either water 'W' or a tree 'T'. A forest is a collection of connected trees. Two trees are connected if they share aside. That is, if they are adjacent to each other. Your task is to print the size of the largest forest for the given information about the field. The size of a forest is the number of trees in it. Look at the example, for a clear understanding.

Format:

Input:

First-line contains the size of the matrix N. The next N lines contain N characters each, either 'W' or 'T'.

Output:

Print the size of the biggest forest.



Constraint:

1 <= N <= 1000



Example:

Input:

5

TTTWW

TWWTT

TWWTT

TWTTT

WWTTT

Output:

10

Explanation:

The forest on the top left has 6 trees, but the forest on the bottom right is bigger with 10 trees.
