Reach the target
Given four integers A, B, C, D. A represents the initial position of Neymar on the x-axis. In each step, Neymar can go to X+B or X-B, if he is standing at X. The task is to check if it is possible for Neymar to reach C exactly after the D steps.



Format:

Input:

1. The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

2. The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, C, and D.

Output:

For each test case, print "yes" if it is possible to reach C in exactly D steps. Otherwise, print "no" (without quotes).



Constraints:

1. 1 <= T <= 5

2. -10^9 <= A, C <= 10^9

3. 1 <= B <= 10^9

4. 1 <= D <= 15



Example:

Input:

3

2 3 8 4

-3 1 0 3

-3 1 1 3

Output:

yes

yes

no

Explanation:

Test case 1: One of the possible ways is {2, 5, 8, 11, 8}.
